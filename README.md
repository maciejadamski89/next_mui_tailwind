## Next.js with MUI and TailwindCSS Template

Based on [link](https://dev.to/hajhosein/nextjs-mui-v5-tutorial-2k35)
and official [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) docummentation I created this template.

It's include:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [React Material UI](https://mui.com)

To use MUI with NextJS some configuration needs to be added becasue of problem with serving CSS files while Server Side Rendering. All works fine with this template.
